	<h1>Documentation</h1>
	
	<p>
		Having gone with an API that offered an easy-to-use dictionary, we made a game finder web application.
		We chose to use the API provided by RAWG, which is "the largest video game database and video game discovery
		service." As fans of both video games and Dungeons & Dragons, we decided to give our webpage a medieval 
		aesthetic. The API gave us access to an abundance of information about AAA titles and indie games alike,
		including their player and Metacritic ratings and the playable platforms. They also provided genres and 
		release dates, and we really wanted to incorporate that information into our website, but we ran out of time.
	</p>
	<p>
		The main issue we currently have is that not all games list the platforms. We didn't really have time to look into
		why that's happening, but the printing works for most games, so we just left it as is.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, we still tried going above and beyond from the original rubric, as we implemented a number of cool effects
		that were not required. For example, we implemented an auto-scroll effect for when you enter a search term. We also
		implemented a modal window jQuery for this documentation, so that it fits in a small and easily customizable 
		pop-up.
	</p>
	<p>
		DISCLAIMER: We do not own any images or fonts presented in this website. Media that were not taken from 
		the API are linked below.
