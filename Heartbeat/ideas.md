#Heartbeat
##Mechanics
*Rhythm based version of Super Hexagon mixed with Undertale’s Undyne fight
*Force players to move in rhythm by intuitively putting up retractable walls around the border
*“Spears” hurling at the player at varying speeds for difficulty 
*Changing colors as they approach for visual assistance (similar to a circle closing around a beat in other rhythm games)
*Lines connecting the spears for extra visual assistance (toggleable for those who want the challenge)
*Force players to spin the shield by making the spears appear counter/clockwise in quick succession
